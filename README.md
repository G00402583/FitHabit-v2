# FitHabit



##  Overview

FitHabit is an Angular-based web app that helps users build and track healthy routines (exercise, hydration, sleep, etc.).  

/**
 * Tracks a single habit entry and displays progress.
 * @example
 * <app-habit-tracker [habit]="runningHabit"></app-habit-tracker>
 */
@Component({ selector: 'app-habit-tracker', /* ... */ })
export class HabitTrackerComponent implements OnInit {
  /** Input data model for this habit */
  @Input() habit!: Habit;

  /**
   * Initializes the component state.
   * Called once after the first ngOnChanges.
   */
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // ...
  }
}
The codebase is organized with clear separation of concerns—each service, guard, and component lives in its own module—and uses JSDoc‑style comments throughout to document classes, methods, parameters, and return values, ensuring readability, maintainability, and ease of onboarding for future developers.
